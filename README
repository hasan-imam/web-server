My first sip of Java! 
Made a simple web server that servers web pages. Supports HTTP/1.0. Created while studying HTTP protocol.

Note: server's listening port is 9999. When requesting page from a browser, be sure to write url in this format:
{server's IP}:{server's port}/{requested page location/path relative to the path where server is executing from}
